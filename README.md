### Philosophy behind the Design

"Using fun to build a sustainable educational ecosytem"

Being a informed citizen shouldn't be a chore, which is why we designed Trivote to prepare voters in an fun and engaging manner. While education is the primary objective of our app, our design philosophy prioritize fun and engagment. This promotes a long term community of engaged active users will love and share the app. There are many online scantron style quizzes that take 20 minutes to complete and even less time to forget. By making the Trivote fun to use, users will naturally come back and be exposed to more knowledge over time.
