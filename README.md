### Philosophy behind the Design

"Using fun to build a sustainable educational ecosytem"

While education is the primary objective of our app, our design philosophy prioritize fun and engagment. This promotes a long term community of engaged active users will love and share the app. There are many online scantron style quizzes that are done in 20 minutes and forgetten just as quickly. By making the app fun to use, users will naturally come back and be exposed to more knowledge over time.

Being a informed citizen shouldn't be a chore, which is why we designed Trivote to prepare voters in an fun and engaging manner.
